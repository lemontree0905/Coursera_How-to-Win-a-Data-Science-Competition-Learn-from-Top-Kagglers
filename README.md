# Coursera_How-to-Win-a-Data-Science-Competition-Learn-from-Top-Kagglers

## Week1 
### Real World Application vs Competitions
- Understanding of business problem (what do you want to do? For what? How can it help your users?) 
- Problem formalization 
- Data collecting
- Data preprocessing
- Modelling 
- Way to evaluate model in real lift
- Way to deploy model (monitor model performance and re-train it on new data)

### Main ML algorithms
- Linear 
  - Good for **sparse high dimensional** data
  - Lasso/Ridge/Logistic Regression; SVM
- Tree-base method 
  - Good for tabular data
  - Hard to capture linear dependencies
  - Decision Tree, Random Forest, GBDT, XGBoost, LightGBM
- KNN-based methods
- Neural Networks
  - Good for **image**, **sounds**, **text**, **sequences**
